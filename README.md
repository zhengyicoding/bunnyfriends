## LLM Usage

Used Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the following use cases and prompts:

### Use case: switch from local MongoDB to MongoDB Atlas

Prompt: How to set up my .env file to input MongoDB Atlas credentials? Do I need to npm install dotenv?

## Instruction to build

### Option 1: Live Demo

### Option 2: Run locally

#### Step 1

Git clone this repository to your local repository.

#### Step 2

`cd` into this repository and run `npm install`.

#### Step 3

Change the contents of .env.example file into your credentials and save it as .env.

#### Step 4

Run `node seeder.js` to import data into your database.

#### Step 5

Run `npm start` to start your local server. Open your browser and input `http://localhost:3000/` and the webpage should show. You can click on "Bunny Gallery" to see collections of Jellycat Bunnies and on "Forum" to browse user stories in there and create/edit/delete your own story. Currently there is no user authentication and authorisation mechanism in place so any user can edit/delete any story posts, which is is an important area of improvement to be done in the future.
