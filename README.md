## Instruction to build

### Option 1: Live Demo

[Bunny Friends Forum](https://bunnyfriends.vercel.app/)

### Option 2: Run locally

#### Step 1

Git clone this repository to your local repository.

#### Step 2

`cd` into this repository and run `npm install`.

#### Step 3

Update the contents of `.env.example` file into your MongoDB Atlas credentials and save it as `.env`.
If using MongoDB locally instead of MongoDB Atlas, use mongodb://localhost:27017 as MONGODB_URI.

#### Step 4

Run `node ./db/seeder.js` to import data into your database.

#### Step 5

Run `npm start` or run `npm run dev` for developer mode to start your local server.  
Open your browser and input `http://localhost:3000/` and the webpage should show.  
You can click on "Bunny Gallery" to see collections of Jellycat Bunnies and on "Forum" to browse user stories in there and create/edit/delete your own story.  
Currently there is no user authentication and authorisation mechanism in place so any user can edit/delete any story posts, which is is an important area of improvement to be done in the future.

## Database:

Collection 1: bunnies, with 52 records of available JellyCat bunnies. Support read on bunnies.
Collection 2: stories, with 1,000 records of story posts on the forum. Support filter by bunny name and CRUD operations on forum posts.

## Approved project idea:

Project Description  
The Fluffy bunny friends forum is a community platform where Jellycat enthusiasts can share stories, experiences, and photos (tentatively) with their beloved fluffy Jellycat bunnies. Main page will show posts of users and a separate page will show a list of currently on-the-market Jellycat bunnies. CRUD operations are available on the posts.  
CRUD Operations  
Create: Users can post photos, stories and experiences with their Jellycat bunnies  
Read: Users can browse posts ordered by create date  
Update: Users can edit their posts information  
Delete: Users can remove their posts
